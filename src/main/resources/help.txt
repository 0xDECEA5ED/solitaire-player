Usage: solitaire-player.bat <Game> <Goal> [args for goal] [-f filename]

When using [-f filename], the file must contain all the cards in a 52-card
deck using two-letter cards of rank (A23456789TJQK) and suit (cdhs), separated
by whitespace.  Then it will print out the solutions without playing the game.

Otherwise, start Microsoft Solitaire Collection on Windows 10 and begin
a game before running this program.  It will scan the cards on screen and
play the solution.

The other command line arguments should be one of the following:
1. Pyramid Board
   Solve Pyramid Board Challenges, such as "Clear 3 board(s) in 2 deal(s)".
2. Pyramid Score
   Solve Pyramid Solitaire for maximum score.
3. Pyramid Score <Goal Score> <Current Score>
   Solve Pyramid Score Challenges, such as "Earn a score of 2400".
   This will know to stop playing if the goal score is reached.
4. Pyramid Card <Number of Cards to Clear> <Rank> <Number Currently Cleared>
   Solve Pyramid Card challenges, such as "Clear 12 Aces in 2 deals".
   - The card ranks to input are: A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, T, J, Q, and K
   - This can potentially have two solutions, one where you clear the board
     and one where you don't (if this removes more cards of the given Rank).
